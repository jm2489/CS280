Choosing Python is like getting a Nintendo Switch: it's intuitive, fun for all ages, and works right out of the box. C++? That’s your high-performance gaming PC master race. It's got the latest graphics card and all the RGB a poweruser could ask for while requiring hours of setup, constant updates, and maybe a cooling system to keep it from overheating. And Java? Java is the Xbox, it's past its prime, always reminiscing of the good ol' days, solid and reliable but insists on downloading patches before you can even start. Python's got the win in my book. While all the other languages requires a lot of setup and resources, Python’s over here saying, 'Let’s just play!' while you're already halfway through Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
