## Folder Structure

The workspace for `Java` contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (if any)
- `bin`: the folder contains compiled executable java code. This can be ignored if compiling directly from the `src` folder using `javac`

The workspace for `C++` will be contained in one folder where:

- `c++`: the folder to maintain sources
